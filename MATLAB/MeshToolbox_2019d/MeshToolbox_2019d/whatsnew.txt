* removed boundary condition continuity, renamed in none with a few improvements in the plot
* fixed some wrong signs in the slides
* remove addProperty and removeProperty methods in class regions
* introduced the properties rho, mu, beta and sigma
* better check of the borders points order to ensure that it respect the program standard
* permuted columns in Mesh.Triangles.Vertices, to use the clockwise order instead 
  of the counter-clockwise order of software "triangle".

2019-01-28
* added support to import of dxf files to define regions

2017-05-19
* fixed a bug with insertNode method of class Boundary

2017-05-16
* fixed a bug in the outputs of regions.rectN and regions.sector preventing 
  mesh2D to refine the mesh (thanks to Stefano Scialò)

2017-05-08
* modified triangle.c to include some missing header files which were generating warnings in MINGW
* modified gpc_mexfile.c to use mwSize data type instead of int in the definition of some variables. This was maybe the cause of an allocation error isseud when recompiling the library using MINGW.
* fixed a bug in the creation of circular domain which was preventing the generation of meshes with specified areas.

2017-04-26
* fixed a bug occurring when a region was multiplied or divided by a scalar quantity (thanks to Angela Scardigli)

2017-02-28
* updated all versions numbers to 2017.1

2016-12-27
* Renamed Shape/Shapes classes to Region/Regions

2016-04-26
* More robust and correct method to find the triangle a generic (x,y) point belongs to. 
    
2016-04-21
* New method to extract the mesh associated to one or more shape from the 
  mesh of a give vector of shapes

2016-03-10
* The library now uses TRIANGLE by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk 
  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
  to generate the triangulation. 
  This mesh generator replaces MESH2D - Automatic Mesh Generation by Darren Engwirda
  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25555-mesh2d-automatic-mesh-generation
  Thanks to Stefano ScialÃ² for suggesting Traingle as a replacement of MESH2D.
* the methods in the mesh2D class have been adapted to work with the new mesh library 

2016-01-12
* added a third parameter to MyNarginCheck for compatibility with MATLAB 2015b

2015-01-12
* changed the properties of the mesh2d object. 
* all the functions/examples have been adapted to the new data structure

2014-06-10
* removed chop in private/createMesh.m
* added second column(global nodes numbering) in Me.PeriodicNodes 
* added 'periodic' option in Me.draw()

2014-06-05
* modified line 36 in private/createMesh.m
    -nodes=MyChop(nodes,10-fix(log10(m)));
    +nodes=MyChop(nodes,24-fix(log2(m)));
    since the function MyChop expects the number of BINARY digits to keep 
    (while the original MATLAB chop was asking for decimal digits)

2014-24-05
* changes: replaced all the for j... and for i... loops using more suitable variables
* new file: MyNarginchk, replacement for narginchk for compatibility on systems with older MATLAB versions
